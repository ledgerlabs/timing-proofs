		<h1>What is an Ether Proof?</h1>
		<p>Register your file in the Ethereum blockchain by uploading your file, generating a cryptographic hash, and paying the low fee of 100 000 wei to cover the transaction costs. Your file will not be kept on this webpage or in the blockchain, only the keccak-256 hash will be.</p>
		<p>The advantages of registering your file here include not revealing the contents of your file but still being able to prove that it exists and getting an Ethereum blockchain certified timestamp that proves your file existed at a certain time on a certain block.</p>
